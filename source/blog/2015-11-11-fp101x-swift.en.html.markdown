I am currently taking [TUDelft's "FP101x - Intro to Functional Programming"](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0) class at edX, and I am enjoying it so far.READMORE

The reason why this exists is because I want to share my exercises that I did from the FP101x class using Swift. Even, the instructor of the class, [Erik Meijer](https://twitter.com/headinthebox), said this a while back:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At this point, <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftLang">@SwiftLang</a> is probably a better, and more valuable, vehicle for learning functional programming than Haskell.</p>&mdash; Erik Meijer (@headinthebox) <a href="https://twitter.com/headinthebox/status/655407294969196544">October 17, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Since there is no swift code that has been found in the class, I ported the haskell file into a Swift playground file. With this, everyone is able practice without the need of taking the actual class.

### Lab2.swift

This is the port of the lab2.hs exercise;

```swift

// Helpers
func eval(digits: [Int]) -> Int {
    return digits.reduce(0, combine: { initValue, digit in
        digit + (initValue * 10)
    })
}

func evalRev(digits: [Int]) -> Int {
    // using reversed iterator because there's no foldr in swift
    var result = 0
    for index in (digits.count-1).stride(through: 0, by: -1) {
        result = (result * 10) + digits[index]
    }
    return result
}

// Ex. 0
func toDigits(digit: Int) -> [Int] {
    return []
}

// Ex. 1
func toDigitsRev(digit: Int) -> [Int] {
    return []
}

// Ex. 2
func doubleSecond(digits: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    return []
}

// Ex. 3
func sumDigits(digits: [Int]) -> Int {
    return 0
}

// Ex. 4
func isValid(digit: Int) -> Bool {
    return false
}
```

### Haskell version

If you are interested to check the original exercise in haskell, you can see it [here](2015-11-11-fp101x-swift/lab2.hs).

## Solution

I will post my solution once its deadline is passed. So please come back after November 26th to discuss and compare our solutions!
