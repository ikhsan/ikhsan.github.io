I feel the urge to detach my tech-related posts from tumblr to a better platform. Two reasons;  code syntax highlighting and localisation. I know you could use workarounds or just use gist for tumblr, but I need more flexibility. READMORE

I researched options and decided to go with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/). Several reasons behind my decision;

- it is an active platform which is created and maintained by great people from [thoughbot](http://thoughtbot.com),
- it is based on ruby which I want to learn more about,
- supports [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/middleman/middleman-syntax) and [localisation](https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/localization/), and
- can be deployed using github pages (free hosting ftw)

Middleman provides templates to kickstart a blog. Even so, it still allows endless customisation if you want to make a full on customised website. This is the sweet spot of balance between easiness and flexibility.

There is a [great walkthrough](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/middleman-bourbon-walkthrough) on how to style out your middleman blog. I highly recommend it if you want to work your middleman site, even I used it to mimic the theme of my [main blog](http://ikhsan.me) into this site.

For more info about the tools, check out [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) (Sass mixin library), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) (grid framework) and [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) (default settings for Bourbon).

## Summary

Although there are many things to setup, but I am pleased with the result. It was rewarding experience for a novice rubyist like me to have created, styled and set up my own site. Check the [source of this page](https://github.com/ikhsan/ikhsan.github.io/tree/develop) if you are interested.
